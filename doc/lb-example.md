# LB Example

This example will tell you how to use vproxy with commands. With this example, you would be able to learn the vproxy resource types and configuring process.

In real world we would expect you to use k8s resources or the vpctl tool to do the configuration, however those tools would eventually generate commands to make the final configuration. It will be much clear for you to use those tools if you understand the commands.

Documentation of all commands appear in this article can be found [here](https://github.com/wkgcass/vproxy/blob/master/doc/command.md).

## Network Topology

Assume we have the following network topology graph:

```
                                  +--------> BACKEND1 (:80)
                                  |          10.0.2.1
                     4c           |
 CLIENT ---------> VPROXY --------+--------> BACKEND2 (:80)
10.0.0.1   10.0.0.10 | 10.0.2.10  |          10.0.2.2
                     |            |
                 10.0.3.10        +--------> BACKEND3 (:80)
                     |                       10.0.2.3
                     |
                     *
                 10.0.3.1
                   ADMIN
```

The vproxy's host has three ip addresses, one in the CLIENT network `10.0.0.0/24`, one in the backend' network `10.0.2.0/24`, one in the admin network `10.0.3.0/24`.

And the vproxy's host has 4 cores.

## BACKEND

```
apt-get install nginx
service nginx start
```

then every server listens on `0.0.0.0:80`.

## VPROXY

#### 1. Start

Start vproxy instance, and configure a `RESPController` for management:

```
tmux

## then start vproxy in tmux terminal

java vproxyapp.app.Main resp-controller 10.0.3.10:16309 m1PasSw0rd
```

Start the vproxy and start a resp-controller and bind `10.0.3.10:16309` for the `ADMIN` to access.

#### 2. Use redis-cli

Start a `redis-cli` on `ADMIN`:

```
redis-cli -h 10.0.3.10 -p 16309 -a m1PasSw0rd
```

The following commands can be executed from the `redis-cli` (telnet also works).

#### 3. Threads

This step can be ignored. The vproxy will automatically start one acceptor thread group and one worker thread group.  
However I would like to show you how to configure them by yourself.

Create two event loop groups: one for accepting connections, and one for handling net flow.

```
add event-loop-group acceptor
add event-loop-group worker
```

We only create one event loop in the `acceptor` event loop group, however, if you expect that there are a lot of new connections to be handled, you can add more event loops into the `acceptor` event loop group.

And because that the host has 4 cores, we create 4 threads for handling net flow.

```
add event-loop acceptor1 to event-loop-group acceptor

add event-loop worker1 to event-loop-group worker
add event-loop worker2 to event-loop-group worker
add event-loop worker3 to event-loop-group worker
add event-loop worker4 to event-loop-group worker
```

#### 4. Backend

Create a server group named `ngx`.

```
add server-group ngx timeout 500 period 1000 up 2 down 3 method wrr event-loop-group worker
```

We use the worker event loop group to run health check.

Attach backend to the group:

```
add server backend1 to server-group ngx address 10.0.2.1:80 weight 10
add server backend2 to server-group ngx address 10.0.2.2:80 weight 10
add server backend3 to server-group ngx address 10.0.2.3:80 weight 10
```

You can use `list-detail` to check current health check status.

```
list-detail server in server-group ngx
```

---

Create a `upstream` resource, and attach group `ngx` to the new resource.  
The `upstream` is used to manage multiple `server-group`s.

```
add upstream backend-groups
add server-group ngx to upstream backend-groups
```

#### 5. TCP LB

Create a loadbalancer and bind `10.0.0.10:80`.

```
add tcp-lb lb0 acceptor-elg acceptor event-loop-group worker address 10.0.0.10:80 upstream backend-groups in-buffer-size 16384 out-buffer-size 16384
```

Then the tcp loadbalancer starts.

#### 6. Check and save config

You can run some special commands in vproxy console, they cannot be executed from `redis-cli`. (Unless you specify `allowSystemCallInNonStdIOController` on start up, but methods related to local filesystem or process will not be allowed for safety concern).

Check config:

```
System call: list config
```

Save config:

```
System call: save ~/vproxy.conf
```

Except for saving by hand, the config can be automatically saved in `~/.vproxy/vproxy.last` for every hour. And if it's terminated by `SIGINT` or `SIGHUP`, or manually shutdown, the config will also be saved.

And last saved config will be loaded if the start up arguments not containing any `load` command.
